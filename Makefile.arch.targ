# Makefile.arch.targ: this Makefile contains targets that will be sourced twice:
# once for each architecture (ia32 and amd64).  This avoids duplicating a bunch
# of recipes that are otherwise identical.
#
# We're able to use the exact same recipe for both 32-bit and 64-bit targets
# because the recipe makes use of target-specific variables that will change the
# command-line as needed.  Specifically, CFLAGS and SOFLAGS will change based on
# the architecture, so as long as we use those variables (or other variables
# that use them), we don't need to do anything differently for the two
# architectures.
