# Makefile.node_modules.defs: Makefile for using NPM modules.
#
# NOTE: This makefile comes from the "eng" repo. It's designed to be dropped
# into other repos as-is without requiring any modifications. If you find
# yourself changing this file, you should instead update the original copy in
# eng.git and then update your repo to use the new version.
#

#
# This Makefile provides a target for building NPM modules from the dependency
# information in the "package.json" file.  The "npm install" operation is
# expensive and produces a complex (multi-file) result which is difficult for
# make to use in dependency analysis.  As such, we use a "stamp" file to track
# successful completion of module installation.
#
# This variable allows the consumer to influence the environment used to run
# NPM commands.
#
#	NPM_ENV			This string should be set to a list of
#				environment variables in the syntax used
#				by bash; e.g.,
#
#					NPM_ENV =	TESTING=yes V=1
#
# Consumers should, for targets which depend on the installation of NPM
# modules, depend on the stamp file using the $(STAMP_NODE_MODULES) variable,
# e.g.:
#
#	.PHONY: all
#	all: $(STAMP_NODE_MODULES)
#
# A phony target, "make stamp-node-modules", is also provided to allow the
# engineer to manually perform NPM module installation without invoking other
# targets.  Note that this target should _not_ be used as a dependency for
# other targets in consuming Makefiles; using phony targets to represent
# intermediate build stages can inhibit the ability of make to determine
# when no additional actions are required.
