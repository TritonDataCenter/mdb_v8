# This file is processed by tools/mkversion.  The value here denotes the current
# version of the debugger module.  Normal (non-release) builds will be tagged
# with this version, plus a "dev" tag that indicates the version is not final.
# For a release build, a "release" tag will be applied.  While there may be many
# "dev" builds with the same version, there should be only one canonical
# "release" build with a given version number.
#
# This value is also used by the "publish" target in the build process.

1.4.0
