# mdb_v8 Developer's Notes

## Contribution guidelines

Contributions welcome, but please help us review your changes (and keep code
quality high) by following these guidelines.  **If you have any questions, feel
free to ask.**  Don't let these guidelines be a barrier to contributing!

If you're not sure exactly what change you want to make, create an issue to
discuss it.  Once you've got a change ready to integrate, submit a pull request.

**Formatting nits**: Pull requests should include text explaining the suggested
change.  (Do not put this text in the commit message.  The commit message should
consist of one line per logical change, each consisting of the issue number and
synopsis.  See previous commit messages for examples.)  Before integration, the
PR should be squashed into one commit.

**Completeness:** Pull requests should include relevant updates to the
documentation, including CHANGES.md.  New commands, walkers, and non-private
options must have associated documentation, both in the dmod (so that "::help
DCMD" works) and in the usage guide.

**Testing**: All changes should be `make prepush` clean, but additional testing
is probably necessary for most changes.  See below.


## Testing

The appropriate level of testing depends on the scope of the change.  Any
non-trivial changes should be tested on:

- core files from each of the latest several major releases of Node
  (e.g., Node v4, Node v0.12, and Node v0.10)
- core files from both 32-bit and 64-bit programs
- core files generated by abort(3c) and core files generated by gcore(1M)

Depending on the change, you may want to test it manually on an existing
collection of representative core files.  If you're not sure about test
requirements, please ask.


### Automated testing

The automated tests are not a comprehensive regression test suite.  Think of
them more as a smoke test.  You can run them by running:

- `make test` (which is run by `make prepush`)
- the `catest` tool, which lets you run individual tests separately
- any of the individual tests by hand (they're standalone programs), which is
  likely easier for debugging the tests

All of these approaches use whichever Node is on your PATH to run a Node program
and generate core files of that program.  Your local build of mdb\_v8 is used to
inspect it.


### Automated testing across different Node versions and architectures

For coverage across 32-bit and 64-bit and multiple Node versions, you can use
the `runtests_node` tool:

1. First, run `runtests_node setup SOME_DIRECTORY`, which downloads the
   supported Node versions into "SOME\_DIRECTORY".
2. Then, run `runtests_node run SOME_DIRECTORY`, which executes the full test
   suite on each of the versions in the directory.

Because we've made it pretty straightforward, we expect all changes to pass the
test suite on all of the versions and architectures used by `runtests_node`.


### Memory leak testing

mdb runs with libumem, which means it's easy to check for memory leaks in C
code.  The process basically looks like this:

1. Open up MDB on a core file and load mdb\_v8.
2. Exercise as much mdb\_v8 functionality as you can (or whatever functionality
   you're trying to test for leaks.
3. _On platforms before illumos issue
   [6338](https://www.illumos.org/issues/6338) was fixed (which is all platforms
   before 2015-10-26)_, run: `::unload libumem.so`.  This is the easiest way to
   work around that issue.
4. Use `gcore` to save a core file of your MDB process.
5. Open up that core file in MDB.  (Yes, this gets confusing: you're using MDB
   to look at a core file of MDB looking at a core file of a Node program.)
6. Run `findleaks -v` to look for leaks.

There's a lot more information about using libumem to debug memory leaks
elsewhere on the web.


### Stress testing

There's a [dumpjsobjects](../tools/dumpjsobjects) tool that takes a core file
and an mdb\_v8 binary and uses `findjsobjects` and `jsprint` to enumerate all of
the objects in a deterministic order and print them out.  With a representative
core file, this is a decent coverage test, since it will likely exercise the
paths for interpreting most types of supported objects.  At the very least, this
should not crash.


### Comparing output across mdb_v8 changes

For some kinds of changes, it's worthwhile to spend time comparing output from
before the change with output after the change to make sure you haven't
introduced any new issues.  The `mdbv8diff` tool can be used to compare the
`dumpjsobjects` output from two different versions of mdb\_v8.

Why not just use `diff(1)`?  The challenge is that many changes to mdb\_v8
change the output format slightly or fix nitty bugs that affect a large number
of objects.  `diff` can easily produce hundreds of thousands of lines of output,
but there may be only a handful of different _kinds_ of changes, and they may
all be easy to programmatically identify (e.g., the wording of a particular
error message changed).  For this reason, `mdbv8diff` provides a small "ignore"
module interface, where you define a function that takes two lines of output
that look different and decides whether the difference corresponds exactly to an
expected change.  Sometimes, a diff represents something that's hard to
programmatically recognize but you've manually confirmed that it's correct.  You
can also add specific values as special cases to ignore.  (These obviously
depend on the specific core file you're debugging.)

The intended workflow is that you run `mdbv8diff` on output from before and
after your change.  It likely finds tons of diffs.  You create a small "ignore"
module.  As you go through the diffs one-by-one, if the diff represents a
regression, you fix your code.  If the diff represents an expected change, you
teach your "ignore" module how to recognize it.  You keep iterating this process
until `mdbv8diff` produces no more output.

This is obviously pretty crude.  Think of this as a tool to assist the otherwise
manual effort of exhaustively comparing lots of output, not an efficient
regression tester.

The "ignore" modules for past changes are committed to the repo for reference,
though they likely wouldn't be reused except to reproduce the original testing
work for the change.
