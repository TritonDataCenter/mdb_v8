# Makefile for the V8 MDB dmod.  This build produces 32-bit and 64-bit binaries
# for mdb_v8 in the "build" directory.
#
# Targets:
#
#     all	builds the mdb_v8.so shared objects
#
#     check	run style checker on source files
#
#     clean	removes all generated files
#
# This Makefile has been designed to work out of the box (without manual or
# automatic configuration) on illumos systems.  Other systems do not support
# MDB, so the build will not work there.  In principle, you can change most
# of the items under the CONFIGURATION sections, but you should not need to.

# Makefile.arch.targ is parametrized by MDBV8_ARCH.  It defines a group of
# the current value of MDBV8_ARCH.  When we include it the first time, it
# defines targets for the 32-bit object files and shared object file.  The
# second time, it defines targets for the 64-bit object files and shared object
# file.  This avoids duplicating Makefile snippets, though admittedly today
# these snippets are short enough that it hardly makes much difference.
